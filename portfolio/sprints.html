            <div class="titleText">Sprint 1</div>
            <br>
            <div class="bodyText">
                For this sprint we got stuff done, which is a good start
                We did not follow the agile development process though
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    First off, working software over comprehensive documentation:
                </div>            
                Out software worked, but it was not technicaly working software because we had not deployed it. On the bright side, the working software did take priority over comprehensive documentation considering we didnt have any documentation so we technicaly followed this value? but not properly because we should still value documentation. something we didnt value during this sprint at all (aside from some git commits)
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    Secondly, Customer collaberation over contract negotiation:
                </div>
                We didn't talk to the customer much during this sprint. Any feature we asked the client about, the client wanted. We need a better way of communicating with the client to figure out what they want. The contract negotiation part doesnt really apply to us considering we dont have a contract and are basically being forced into slave labour
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    Thirdly, Responding to change over following the plan: 
                </div>
                On one hand, we didnt have much of a plan this sprint to begin with, so we kind of valued response to change over following the plan, but I think we should value these both more in the future. There also wasnt much change if any for us to respond to so we probably should have valued a plan over that for this sprint
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    Lastly, Individuals and interactions, over processes and tools:
                </div>            
                We didnt make much use of any of the tools provided to us this sprint, so like with the other values, we technicaly checked this one off, but we should have made more use of the tools available to us. Our communication existed this sprint, which is better than nothing. We talked about problems we were having with trying to get stuff to work and when we should meet up. I think out communication actually went ok for this sprint
                <br> <br>
                In general, I dont think we did a very good job with being agile for this sprint, and we have a fair few things to improve on. One big problem I had this sprint was not knowing who was doing what, so I didnt want to do anything in case it overlapped with what someone else was already doing. I could have solved this by just asking, and/or by us making use of the assigning issues thing on github 
            </div>

            <div class="titleText">Sprint 2</div>
            <br>
            <div class="bodyText">
                This sprint went considerably better than the last one, but we could still do better I think.
                We did a better job of following the agile development process
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    First off, working software over comprehensive documentation:
                </div>            
                    We had working software this time around. The website was hosted and could be accessed from any computer. But again, the only documentation we had was with git commits, something we still need to improve on.
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    Secondly, Customer collaberation over contract negotiation:                    
                </div>
                    Our customer collaberation went better this time around, we talked to the customer and offered up a list of features we planned on implementing and then asked for their thoughts. I feel asking a more open ended question like that rather than 'do you like this. yes or no.' leads to the customer feeling more involved and lets us understand more of what they want. I think we do still need to talk to the customer more though. Again there was no contract to negotiate.
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    Thirdly, Responding to change over following the plan: 
                </div>
                    We had more of a plan this time around which was good. We were assigned tasks on github that we decided on at the start of the sprint. We did a good job of following this plan while also adapting to problems as they came. For example, towards the end of the sprint, one of the tasks I wasnt originaly assigned to wasnt done. I assigned myself to this task as well as the person who was already on the task and took it upon myself to get it done. This is where I failed to communicate though. I hadn't made it clear to everyone that I had also been assigned to the task.
                    Once I had pushed the completed task up to Github, the other team member on the task noticed and told me they were just about to finish it, so we ended up wasting some time both doing the same task.
                <br> <br>
                <div class="headingText">
                    Lastly, Individuals and interactions, over processes and tools:
                </div>            
                    This one kind of links back to the previous one, with us being assigned tasks on Github and sticking to our tasks, while helping eachother as needed. The failing of communication is also the same, there waas an attempt to
                    prioritise the Individuals and interactions ove rthe process and tools, but because of a lack of communication that caused some issues.
                <br> <br>
                In general, I think we improved a lot with this sprint but for the next sprint we need to consider improving out communication. We also havent had any proper stand up meetings yet so that's something we should do
