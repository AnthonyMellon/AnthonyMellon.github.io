                The meta-flection.
                A reflection on my (lack of) reflections.
                I‚Äôve been a little slack. As in, doing my portfolio for the first week and then ever again slack.
                Or still not reflecting on Sprint 1 slack. Or writing this with my last hour of free time before class when these are being looked at slack. The big question is, why have I been slack? These don‚Äôt take much effort and I have 5 hours to kill between classes on Mondays. The reflections don‚Äôt take much effort either. I don‚Äôt have a proper answer to this, but I can say what I do end up doing instead of this. I play Pokemon  Go and browse reddit while im stuck at polytech. I get stuck watching youtube while im at home or I do work that really doesn‚Äôt need to be done but it‚Äôs the fun kind of work like playing with the zumo bot so I can say I did work and feel good about it without really doing any work. I mean, I do do some work at home, im doing some right now by writing this, so I guess I shouldn‚Äôt ask why I don‚Äôt do work, but instead why I do do work (when I actually do it). For one, I do work when its due and I have no other options left for putting it off. I also do work real late at night when I‚Äôve ran out of all other excuses to not go to bed. And sometimes ill just randomly feel like doing work and then ill get stuck into it and get something done. And I think that is the key, I think I struggle with starting to do work rather than actually doing work. Even now that I‚Äôve started writing this, im not having a bad time and if I didn‚Äôt have to go to work soon id probably go on to reflect on sprint 1 and 2. So this leads onto the next question I need to answer. How am I going to sort this out? the whole point of this class is to reflect and improve, so I kind of have to improve if I want to pass. I could just say that I‚Äôd set myself deadlines and manage my time better, but I think that‚Äôd be a bit stupid answer. I know for a fact that I do not have the self-discipline to follow through on self-imposed deadlines, I‚Äôve tried it before, it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. And I also know that I don‚Äôt need to ‚Äòmanage‚Äô my time better, I already have plenty of free time to do work in. I need to somehow get over my thought process of ‚ÄòI should do some work now, but first I‚Äôll watch one video on youtube‚Äô because then I just get stuck in a ‚Äòone more‚Äô loop. I need to decide to start working, and then actually start working. I don‚Äôt know how to make myself do that, or at least, how to prove that ill make my self do it. But I can prove that I have done it, just not yet. That‚Äôs a future thing for a future reflection once I‚Äôve actually done it.
                I hope this was concise. I kind of just wrote it and now I need to go to work so I don‚Äôt have time to check over it, or time to write a sprint 1 and 2 reflection, but I can give a sneak peak;
                Sprint 1 was ok, a little disorganised and we lacked communication. Sprint 2 was better because we learned a lot from sprint 1. We communicated, we branched, and we use GitHub properly(ish). We still need to improve, but that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre students and not highly paid experts. üëç

                I've found that the thing that motivates me is having something to show off. For example, making a cool website. If i want to get more work done, I need more ways of showing off.
                I think a good system (or at least a system) is to create cool features for this website as a practice for other classes, and using my reflections as a purpose and as content for this website.
                I think my next step for this is using react as a practice for Intermediate app dev.
                <br>
                Also having the website live means Adon can look at my portfolio at any time to see if im actualy doing anything, motivating me through fear.
