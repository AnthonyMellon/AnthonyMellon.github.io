                I found being left alone to work at my own pace to be a good thing. It let me get through the work without having to worry about keeping up with everyone else. I think I got a good amount of work done in the amount of time I had but I could have done more work if I had headphones with me so I could watch tutorials online. I feel like I learn better watching tutorials rather than reading walls of text. Next time I will be sure to bring headphones with me.

                I forgot to bring headphones to this class meaning I didn’t act on my reflection of last class. My plan was to grab them on my way out in the morning but I ended up forgetting in the morning. I’ve put them in my bag now so I cant forget next time. In this class we were left to make a simple website that lets you add books to a displayed list. My group struggled to do this and ended up not completing the task. I’ve now realised that I need to improve my html skills before next class.

                In todays class, the whole topic of our website changed from being based on games, to being based on cars. We will soon learn what it truely means to be agile.
                I think this has demotivated our group and it lead to us getting next to no work done this class. Because of this there isnt much for me to reflect on other than that we should learn to be more adaptive
                and ready for change.
